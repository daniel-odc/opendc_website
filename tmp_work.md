## Machine learning algorithms for traffic count data anomaly detection

* The context 

Our client operates the road network in the Val-de-Marne department, bordering Paris. Over the past years they contracted multiple suppliers to survey count vehicles on their network. This data has been provided in different formats for each supplier and for some of them, no quality checks have been run on the final data.
Our client wanted to gather all this data in a unified database and run automatic testings to verify the quality of the count data and eventually automatically correct the outliers. 


* What we did:

We first developed dedicate scripts to ingest the data from the various suppliers. Over 1000 Excel files have been ingested and their relevant information extracted and structured.
We developed a machine learning process based on time series analysis in order to detect inconsistencies and outliers in the data. When possible we corrected the data using trends based on the observed past and future data. We delivered the structured unified database with all historical count data, keeping both the raw and corrected data.

* The value for our client

The information provided by several suppliers over the past years could be valued, checked and reused. Our client could use the structured and corrected data in their own GIS environment and be able to interrogate all their historical traffic count data from a single data source, making their traffic reduction policy appraisal much more easy and scientific.

## Paris 2024 Transport and Mobility team

* The context 

The organisation of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games required excellent expertise in terms of transports and crowd modelling, GIS processing and project management. The Transport and Mobility (TRM) team contacted OpenDC's director a year before the games to discuss the opportunity of joining the team until the games.


* What we did:

Working for the organisation of the Olympics in Paris is a once in a lifetime opportunity. OpenDC's director accepted then this proposition and slowed down OpenDC's activity for a year to assist the TRM team with the organisation of the spectators and accredited people transportation during the games. We worked with the local authorities in all the host cities (Paris, Marseille, Nice, Lyon, Saint-Etienne etc.) to build the spectators transport plan, assist the team with technical tasks such as managing and building the GIS database, estimating the travel times during the games (taking into account the Olympic Lanes), locating and designing the wayfinding panes, defining the optimal itineraries for the athletes travels etc.

* The value for our client

The transportation during the Olympics in Paris has been widely recognised as a huge success. This is the result of a strong collaboration between all the stakeholders - public and private - and a strong team inside the olympic committee, where all members brought their abilities and motivation, including OpenDC's director.  


## Crowd modelling for multi-education site in Paris

* The context 

The French top-tier agronomic engineering school Agro ParisTech has moved since 2022 from the 5th district in Paris to the scientific cluster of Plateau de Saclay (south of Paris). The historical building in Paris centre has been ceded to [Galileo Global Education](https://www.ggeedu.fr/) and will host a number of education institutions, spanning from Business school to the famous theatre course "Cours Florent".
The expected number of students is high, so are the site constraints, with narrow corridors, doors and protected building construction.
Our client contacted OpenDC to run a crowd modelling analysis, checking that the design of the environment could accommodate the arrivals and departures of staff and students at peak time.


* What we did:

We gathered all the assumptions in terms of space design and students schedules. We developed a dynamic pedestrian flow model, simulating the arrivals and departures of students at peak times, highlighting pinchoints and estimating future congestion and delays.
We ran multiple scenarios to propose a routing solution minimising the crowd densities and ensuring comfort and safety to students everywhere in the building.

* The value for our client

Thanks to our analysis our client could anticipate the risks of congestion and their location. They could subsequently update their circulation plan inside the building. The quantitative analysis based on the new circulation plan reinsured all the stakeholders that both planned schedule and available space could guarantee the future students and staff a high level of comfort and security. 

## Web platform for traffic count data analysis and visualisation

* The context 

Our client has been collecting traffic count data for the past 30 years in the region of Paris and more widely in France. This very valuable data source is spread across hundreds of thousands of files, which makes it cumbersome to find information about historical data at a given location on the road network.
They asked OpenDC to help them gather and structure this data and enable access through a secure web platform.


* What we did:

We developed a process to extract the data from the multiple files and structured it in a unified database. We also developed a web application and an API to secure the connection to the application, ingest new data from local files and visualise and analyse the data through a very intuitive and seamless user interface.

* The value for our client

Our client has now easy access to their own data to develop their models and run their analysis. They also have the opportunity to grant access to the platform to their end-clients for accessing the traffic count data they have purchased. No more data loss due to people leaving the organisation and taking with them their memories about where the data has been stored...
