#### What OpenDC can do
OpenDC can help you find among the thousands of webpages the open data sets  that can help your organisation unlock new insights.
Some of this data will be too big to be analysed by usual tools like Excel. OpenDC can help you load and analyse this data using open source programming tools such as Python libraries or PostgreSQL databases.
Once this data is identified and loaded, OpenDC can help you analyse the patterns in the data, cross the information with external independent datasets to find correlations, answer the questions you have asked and perhaps the ones you have not.
