#### What OpenDC can do
OpenDC mainly uses the <a href="https://qgis.org/en/site/" target="_blank"/>QGIS</a> framework as a Geographic Information System (GIS) tool. With QGIS, OpenDC can provide communicative maps as well as perform advanced GIS analysis such as the analysis of catchment areas but also advanced routing features. OpenDC can also provide GIS training in general and on QGIS in particular.
