<h4>What we did:</h4> 
<p>
The TfL EDMOND project aimed to build Origin-Destination (OD) matrices in the Greater London Authority (GLA) unsing mobile network data fused with external datasets.
</p>
<p>
As part of the Telefónica UK team in a joint project involving two major consultancies (<a><href = "http://www.jacobs.com/">Jacobs</a> and <a><href = "https://www.aecom.com/">AECOM</a>), we managed the team of analysts at Telefónica in charge of collecting, cleaning, filtering, scaling and analysing the mobile network data.
</p>

<h4>How we use open data or software:</h4>
<p>
Mobile network data is not open data. However, a lot of external datasets are required to scale the data, calibrate and validate the models developed to give intelligence to this bulky and relatively dumb raw data. Open datasets were widely used to understand how representative of the global population the data was and how to correct for the eventual biases.
</p>

<h4>What was the value for our client:</h4>
<p>
This collaboration of transport planners and data analysts has given our client TfL the opportunity to succesfully complete a ground breaking project in transport, where OD matrices at a national scale were for the first time built from mainly observed data rather than models. After having understood the limitations of the data and added intelligence to compensate these limitations, TfL were confident that these matrices will be deliver reliable outputs for driving the mayor of London transport policy.
