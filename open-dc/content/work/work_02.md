<h4>What we did:</h4> 
<p>
We created a toll analysing commuting open data from the French ordnance survey (<a><href = "https://www.insee.fr/en/accueil">INSEE</a>) to help our client understand how commuting data can give insights on how nieghbouring cities bound together and define perimeters that are sometimes at odds with the official administration boundaries.
</p>

<h4>How we use open data or software:</h4>
<p>
We used French national ordnance survey data from <a><href="https://www.insee.fr/en/accueil">INSEE</a> before it was called open data. We have developed the code to analyse the about 8 millions rows commuting information in C++ and have provided to our client a user-friendly custom interface to enable them adapting their research to their needs.
</p>

<h4>What was the value for our client:</h4>
<p>
Our client could push their deep understanding of urban planning in the region of Paris one step further, gaining new insights about interactions between neigbouring cities. This work was presented at the <a><href = "http://www.ateliergrandparis.fr/">Atelier International du Grand Paris</a> (AIGP) and was among the 10 teams of architects selected by the AIGP to help defining a metropolitan common interest for the region.
