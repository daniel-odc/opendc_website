<h4>The context:</h4> 
<p>
Our client (a French public administration) has 1000 employees working on different sites located in the region of Paris. Most of the employees commute by private vehicle. Our client is looking at the opportunity of using a new single site for all employees. They want to understand the impact of the new site on the employees’ individual travel time and mode share evolution.
</p>

<h4>What we did:</h4>
<p>
We collected anonymously the addresses, current workspace and mode share of every employee. We used the Google Maps API to estimate the current and future travel times of each employee, using their current mode share but also using public transportation, bicycle and walk (when appropriate). We provided to the client a full and complete analysis of the gains and loss of travel time for every employee, using a constant mode share and switching to the most efficient mode share.
We demonstrated the value of cycling to work when it comes to optimising the commuter’s travel time.
</p>

<h4>The value for our client:</h4>
<p>
Our client was able to quantify the impact of moving site on every employee individually as well as globally on average for all employees. Furthermore, the client could demonstrate the value of cycling to work as opposed to using private vehicles.
