<h4>The context:</h4> 
<p>

Our partner (EGIS Transport Solution) works with <a href="https://www.skeyes.be/en/" target="_blank" >Skeyes</a>, an autonomous public company in charge of the safety of air traffic in the civil airspace for which the Belgian State is responsible. Their data team has among other tasks the charge of analysing flight level off data (ie. the number of times an aircraft levels off during its descent phase). This process was really time consuming and required optimisation for scaling.

</p>

<h4>What we did:</h4>
<p>
We developed Python scripts to process the Skeyes data and transform the raw inputs into formatted data with relevant insights extracted, ready to be visualised in Tableau software.
We also trained the Skeyes team on the Python programming language, best practice and use of developing interface.

</p>

<h4>The value for our client:</h4>
<p>
Several days are saved every month and the team can now focus more on the engineering side of their role. Less errors are reported, larger datasets are processed and the team can now scale up with more confidence.
