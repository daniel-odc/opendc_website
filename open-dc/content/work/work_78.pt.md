<h4>The context:</h4> 
<p>

The <a href= "https://www.networkrail.co.uk/running-the-railway/intelligent-infrastructure/">Network Rail Intelligent Infrastructure (II)</a> program aims to turn the data collected by thousands of sensors into intelligent information that helps maintenance teams move towards proactive ways of working. The E&P (Electrification and Plant) stream gathered our team to help them build a robust DST (Decision Support Tool) that helps their staff get the right information at the right time, making it easier to deliver improved services for passengers and freight customers.

</p>

<h4>What we did:</h4>
<p>

We got familiar with the NR Ellipse data management system to understand the asset data available in hundreds of tables. We did a thorough analysis of the available and missing data, as well as an assessment of the quality of the data in terms of completion and reliability. 
We also collected billions of measurements points for OLE (Overhead Line Equipment), CRE (Conductor Rail Equipment) and P&D (Plant & Distribution) assets and implemented a methodology of measurement to asset allocation.
We finally worked with the Cognizant team to help integrate the methodology to the DST dataflow.


</p>

<h4>The value for our client:</h4>
<p>

The technical abilities of our team and our agile way of working, with daily 30 minutes meetings enabled a quick understanding of a complex environment, with its strengths, limitations and full potential. Within a few months of development, the client could see the main features of the DST implemented and communicate to their teams in a very user-friendly way years of measurements of the state of their infrastructure.
