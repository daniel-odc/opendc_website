<h4>What we did:</h4> 
<p>
We helped our client build a public transport assignment tool plugged into their in-house private transport assignment tool. We then collected open data of observed mode choice for commute at an aggregate level. Using privtae and public transportation travel times derived from the assignment tool, we have infered a simple model giving a mode probablity as a function of the travel time difference. 
</p>

<h4>How we use open data or software:</h4>
<p>
We have collected open data via GTFS feeds and online time tables to build a database of the public transport network of the Paris region. We have also collected and analysed commuting public data sets giving proportions of trips between different cities using each transportation mode.
</p>

<h4>What was the value for our client:</h4>
<p>
Mode choice forecast is a difficult exercise that usually relies on various assumptions, and as behavioural element, implies a lot of uncertainty. However, not trying to forecast mode changes leads to unreliable model outputs where assignment on road sections exceeds their capacity. The development of this simple model enabled our client to easilty communicate the method to their end-clients and strengthened their private transportation forecasts.
