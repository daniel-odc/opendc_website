<h4>The context:</h4> 
<p>

Our client (Network Rail High Speed) uses on a daily basis a planning Excel spreadsheet that is transformed every week into a PDF tasks schedule file sent to each member of their staff working on field operations. The data input and transformation processes are all manual, error-prone and time consuming. Many hours are lost every week setting up this planning file.

</p>

<h4>What we did:</h4>
<p>

We developed a fully automated process, written in VBA, that transforms the raw input into final PDF files, making all the necessary transformations in between.

</p>

<h4>The value for our client:</h4>
<p>
A quote from the client is better than any description:

<em>“Giving my team member back 2 days a week is outstanding. Your team took no time to understand our plans, some people here still can’t work out our planning spreadsheet after years! Our current system has needed an update for years & has been a huge risk but you have created a new working system in a few months. Thank you again & look forward to phase 2 & beyond”</em>
