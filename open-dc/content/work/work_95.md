<h4>The context:</h4> 
<p>
The “Triangle de Bellesmes” sector, near Euro Disney in the Paris region is meant to be urbanised with new houses, offices, a show arena and a congress centre. This urbanisation will generate new pedestrian flows with different volumes and profiles depending on the time of the day, the type of events hosted by the arena and the congress centre, the type of homes etc. Our client wanted to make sure that the project assumptions were compatible with the comfort and safety of the pedestrians passing through the site, at any location and time of the day.
</p>

<h4>What we did:</h4>
<p>
We gathered assumptions in terms of number of houses, jobs, parking locations and spaces, number of expected visitors for the arena and the congress centre. We applied ratios to convert these assumptions into flow demand and set up arrival and departure profiles for each type of visitors. We used then all these assumptions in a dynamic pedestrian flow assignment model over three different periods to understand where issues could be expected in terms of level of service (ie pedestrian density) and proposed mitigation measures.
</p>

<h4>The value for our client:</h4>
<p>
Our modelling approach and our understanding of the wider environment (Euro Disney, nearby train station etc.) has made possible to set up an accurate modelling of the site and future behaviours in very little time. The analysis covered an area spanning over a couple of km, which gave confidence to our client that his project was not conflicting with surrounding activities and that ingress and egress phases of the arena and congress centre could append in a safe and comfortable way for their visitors.
