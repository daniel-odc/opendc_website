<h4>What we did:</h4> 
<p>
We developed a pedestrian dynamic assignment software, with an assignment algorithm based on fluid mechanics principles. The tool can assign an unlimited number of pedestrians, at any scale and custom flow density relationship can be implemented.
</p>

<h4>How we use open data or software:</h4>
<p>
The tool was computed as a <a href = "https://qgis.org/en/site/" target="_blank">QGIS</a> plugin, open source software providing an open source API. The user interface has been developed in Python and the core assignment algorithm in C++.
</p>

<h4>What was the value for our client:</h4>
<p>
The client has an in-house tool, fast and user-friendly and used on a daily basis by the modelling team. The tool saves modelling and computation time and minimizes the probability of calculation mistakes compared to spreadsheet based modelling approaches. The efficiency of the code as well as the ability to be parallelized enable the run of thousands of scenarios in a few minutes, which gives robustness to the understanding of the variability of the model outputs.
