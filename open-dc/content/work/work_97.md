<h4>The context:</h4> 
<p>
Following the development of the Triangle de Bellesmes area, our client who manages the road network around Disneyland Paris was willing to estimate whether the increase of new pedestrians following this new development would increase the risk of accidents between cars, BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) and pedestrians.
</p>

<h4>What we did:</h4>
<p>
We have reviewed several accidentology reports, from studies carried out in France, London, New York and Denmark to analyse the main accidentology factors in similar road environments. We have also analysed the French accidentology national database to extract quantitative historical data about accidents between buses, cars, pedestrians and cyclists to verify that the results from the above studies were valid in our environment. A list of main factors for accidentology was extracted from this analysis and provided to our client as well as mitigation measures.
</p>

<h4>The value for our client:</h4>
<p>
The use of open data made the analysis diligent, and our client was provided with a simple but thorough analysis of the main accidentology factors in areas similar to the one he manages. He was then able to implement mitigation measures such as speed limitation and disposition of the BRT lanes far ahead of the finalisation of the project.
