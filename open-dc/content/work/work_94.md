<h4>What we did:</h4> 
<p>
Our project aimed to build Origin-Destination (OD) matrices split by modes in a dense and populated region using mobile network data fused with external datasets.
As part of a major telco company, in a joint project involving two transport consultancies, we managed the team of analysts in charge of collecting, cleaning, filtering, scaling and analysing the mobile network data.
</p>

<h4>How we use open data or software:</h4>
<p>
Mobile network data is not open data. However, a lot of external datasets are required to scale the data, calibrate and validate the models developed to give intelligence to the raw data. Open datasets were widely used to understand how representative of the global population the data was and how to correct for the eventual biases.
</p>

<h4>What was the value for our client:</h4>
<p>
This collaboration of transport planners and data analysts has given our client the opportunity to successfully complete a ground breaking project in transport, where OD matrices at a national scale were for the first time built from mainly observed data rather than models. After having understood the limitations of the data and added intelligence to compensate these limitations, our client was confident that these matrices will deliver reliable outputs for driving the coming years transport policies.
