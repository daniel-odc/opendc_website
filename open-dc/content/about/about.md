<a><href = "https://www.ensta-paristech.fr/en">ENSTA ParisTech</a> (France) and <a><href = "http://www-instn.cea.fr/en/">INSTN CEA Saclay.</a></p>
<p>Daniel has over 10 years experience in mathematical modelling for transportation, mobility and pedestrian studies and data analysis. 
<p>Currently, OpenDC is a one-person company providing contracting work for consultancies and public bodies. OpenDC is meant to grow bigger as the availability of open data, open source software and the need to found decisions on transparent data, assumptions and models are likely to do.</p>
