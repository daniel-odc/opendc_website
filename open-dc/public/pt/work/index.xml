      <description>Client:   Partners: -  Sector: Web development   The context: 
The world global warming and current energy crisis are pushing us, people, companies and public bodies to limit our carbon emissions. To do so, we first need to understand their sources before being able to reduce them. In France, 30% of the carbon emissions come from the transport industry. The transport in France has many purposes, the commute being a significant one in terms of volume.</description>

      <description>Client:   Partners:   Sector: Data analysis   The context: 
The Seine-et-Marne department (77) is the largest department in the Paris region, occupying almost half the area of the full region. It is made of a mix of rural areas as well as dense areas or under heavy development (Marne la Vallée sectors including Disneyland, etc.). The local authority stakeholders wanted to get a global vision of the mobility patterns in this inhomogeneous territory as well as an understanding of its public transportation gaps, without having to run a long and expensive survey.</description>
