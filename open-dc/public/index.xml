      <description>What OpenDC can do OpenDC can help you find among the thousands of webpages the open data sets that can help your organisation unlock new insights. Some of this data will be too big to be anlaysed by usual tools like Excel. OpenDC can help you load and analyse this data using open source programming tools such as Python libraries or PostgreSQL databases. Once this data is identified and loaded, OpenDC can help you analyse the patterns in the data, cross the information with external independant datasets to find correlations, answer the questions you have asked and the ones you have not.</description>

      <description>Client: Movement Strategies Ltd     Sector: Pedestrian modelling   
 What we did:  We developed a pedestrian dynamic assignment software, with an assignment algorithm based on fluid mechanics principles. The tool can assign an unlimited number of pedestrians, at any scale and cutom flow desnity relationship can be implemented. How we use open data or software:  The tool was computed as a QGIS plugin, open source software providing an open source API.</description>

      <description>Client: CDVIA     Sector: Transport modelling   
 What we did:  We helped our client build a public transport assignment tool plugged into their in-house private transport assignment tool. We then collected open data of observed mode choice for commute at an aggregate level. Using privtae and public transportation travel times derived from the assignment tool, we have infered a simple model giving a mode probablity as a function of the travel time difference.</description>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>OpenDC has been founded in 2019 by Daniel Marin, engineer from ENSTA ParisTech (France) and INSTN CEA Saclay.
Daniel has over 10 years experience in mathematical modelling for transportation, mobility and pedestrian studies and data analysis. Currently, OpenDC is a one-person company providing contracting work for consultancies and public bodies. OpenDC is meant to grow bigger as the availability of open data, open source software and the need to found decisions on transparent data, assumptions and models are likely to do.</description>
