      <description>What OpenDC can do OpenDC can help you find among the thousands of webpages the open data sets that can help your organisation unlock new insights. Some of this data will be too big to be analysed by usual tools like Excel. OpenDC can help you load and analyse this data using open source programming tools such as Python libraries or PostgreSQL databases. Once this data is identified and loaded, OpenDC can help you analyse the patterns in the data, cross the information with external independent datasets to find correlations, answer the questions you have asked and perhaps the ones you have not.</description>

      <description>Company: Movement Strategies Ltd     Client: Internal project   --  Sector: Pedestrian modelling   What we did:  We developed a pedestrian dynamic assignment software, with an assignment algorithm based on fluid mechanics principles. The tool can assign an unlimited number of pedestrians, at any scale and custom flow density relationship can be implemented. How we use open data or software:  The tool was computed as a QGIS plugin, open source software providing an open source API.</description>

      <description>Company: CDVIA     Client: Agence D&amp;A     Sector: Urban planning   What we did:  We created a tool analysing commuting data from the French National Institute of Statistics (INSEE) to help our client understand how commuting data can give insights on how neighbouring cities bound together and define perimeters that can sometimes be at odds with the official administration boundaries. How we use open data or software:  We used French national ordnance survey data from INSEE before it was called open data.</description>

      <description>What OpenDC can do OpenDC mainly uses the QGIS framework as a Geographic Information System (GIS) tool. With QGIS, OpenDC can provide communicative maps as well as perform advanced GIS analysis such as the analysis of catchment areas but also advanced routing features. OpenDC can also provide GIS training in general and on QGIS in particular.

      <description>What OpenDC can do OpenDC can develop for you custom QGIS plugins under the QGIS API. Note that any QGIS plugin that is publicly released has to be open-source. You can however use your plugin internally if you do not want to release the code. 
How this service can help your organisation You might be interested in a custom QGIS plugin if you are working for a
Non Governmental Organisation (NGO) with interesting geographical datasets that you want to make available to the GIS community in order to enable the wide analysis of this data set.</description>

      <description>Company: CDVIA     Client: Internal project   --  Sector: Transport modelling   What we did:  We helped our client build a public transport assignment tool plugged into their in-house private transport assignment tool. We then collected open data of observed mode choice for commute at an aggregate level. Using private and public transportation travel times derived from the assignment tools, we have inferred a simple model giving a mode probability as a function of the difference of travel time between public and private transportation options.</description>

      <description>What OpenDC can do OpenDC mainly uses open-source tools and languages but stays pragmatic when a language or an application is popular but not open-source. Therefore OpenDC also uses the VBA language to automate processes on any Microsoft Office application. Python, C++ and SQL are generally used for any other applications.

      <description>OpenDC has been founded in 2019 by Daniel Marin, engineer from ENSTA ParisTech (France) and INSTN CEA Saclay.  Daniel has over 10 years experience in mathematical modelling for transportation, mobility and pedestrian studies and data analysis.  Currently, OpenDC is a one-person company providing contracting work for consultancies and public bodies. However, OpenDC has a network of larger companies specialized in pedestrian and transport modelling and ready to partner if a project requires large teams.</description>
