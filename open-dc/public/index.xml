      <description>What OpenDC can do OpenDC can help you find among the thousands of webpages the open data sets that can help your organisation unlock new insights. Some of this data will be too big to be analysed by usual tools like Excel. OpenDC can help you load and analyse this data using open source programming tools such as Python libraries or PostgreSQL databases. Once this data is identified and loaded, OpenDC can help you analyse the patterns in the data, cross the information with external independent datasets to find correlations, answer the questions you have asked and perhaps the ones you have not.</description>

      <description>What OpenDC can do OpenDC can develop for you custom QGIS plugins under the QGIS API. Note that any QGIS plugin that is publicly released has to be open-source. You can however use your plugin internally if you do not want to release the code. 
How this service can help your organisation You might be interested in a custom QGIS plugin if you are working for a
Non Governmental Organisation (NGO) with interesting geographical datasets that you want to make available to the GIS community in order to enable the wide analysis of this data set.</description>

      <description>What OpenDC can do OpenDC mainly uses open-source tools and languages but stays pragmatic when a language or an application is popular but not open-source. Therefore OpenDC also uses the VBA language to automate processes on any Microsoft Office application. Python, C++ and SQL are generally used for any other applications.

      <description>Company: CDVIA     Client: Internal project   --  Sector: Transport modelling   What we did:  We helped our client build a public transport assignment tool plugged into their in-house private transport assignment tool. We then collected open data of observed mode choice for commute at an aggregate level. Using private and public transportation travel times derived from the assignment tools, we have inferred a simple model giving a mode probability as a function of the difference of travel time between public and private transportation options.</description>
