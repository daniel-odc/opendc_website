<h4>What we did:</h4> 
<p>
We helped our client build a public transport assignment tool plugged into their in-house private transport assignment tool. We then collected open data of observed mode choice for commute at an aggregate level. Using private and public transportation travel times derived from the assignment tools, we have inferred a simple model giving a mode probability as a function of the difference of travel time between public and private transportation options. 
</p>

<h4>How we use open data or software:</h4>
<p>
We have collected open data via GTFS feeds and online timetables to build a database of the public transportation network of the Paris region. We have also collected and analysed commuting public data sets giving proportions of trips between different cities using each transportation mode.
</p>

<h4>What was the value for our client:</h4>
<p>
Mode choice forecasting is a difficult exercise that usually relies on various assumptions and segmentations, and the behavioural element introduces a lot of uncertainty. However, not trying to forecast mode choice evolutions leads to unreliable model outputs where assignment on road sections exceeds their capacity. The development of this simple model enabled our client to easily communicate the method to their end-clients and strengthened their private transportation forecasts. Our client's model is currently used by most of the local authorities in the region of Paris.
